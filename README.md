Android app which let you stream real-time sensor data from your phone to Websocket clients. Clients, including web browsers and other applications running on PCs or mobile devices, are able to receive streamed data through the WebSocket client API. Since this application functions as a Websocket Server, you will require a Websocket Client API to establish a connection with the application. To obtain a Websocket library for your preferred programming language click [here](https://github.com/facundofarias/awesome-websockets). With this app, you can effortlessly stream real-time sensor data from your phone to any application, allowing you to monitor the device's movement, environment, and position in real-time.
 
 
 
 
 # Usage
 To receive sensor data, **Websocket client**  must connect to the app using following **URL**.
 
                 ws://<ip>:<port>/sensor/connect?type=<sensor type here> 
 
 
  Value for the `type` parameter can be found by navigating to **Available Sensors** in the app. 
 
 For example
 
 * For **accelerometer** `/sensor/connect?type=android.sensor.accelerometer` .
 
 * For **gyroscope** `/sensor/connect?type=android.sensor.gyroscope` .
 
 * For **step detector**  `/sensor/connect?type=android.sensor.step_detector`

 * so on... 
 
 Once connected, client will receive sensor data in `JSON Array` (float type values) through `websocket.onMessage`.

 ```json
{
  "accuracy": 2,
  "timestamp": 3925657519043709,
  "values": [0.31892395,-0.97802734,10.049896]
}
 ```

where

| Array Item  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| values[0]  | Acceleration force along the x axis (including gravity)  |
| values[1]  | Acceleration force along the y axis (including gravity)  |
| values[2]  | Acceleration force along the z axis (including gravity)  |

And [timestamp](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent#timestamp) is the time in nanoseconds at which the event happened

Use `JSON` parser to get these individual values.

 
**Note** : *Use  following links to know what each value in **values** array corresponds to*
- For motion sensors [/topics/sensors/sensors_motion](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_motion)
- For position sensors [/topics/sensors/sensors_position](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_position)
- For Environmental sensors [/topics/sensors/sensors_environment](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_environment)

## Undocumented (mostly QTI) sensors on Android devices
Some Android devices have additional sensors like **Coarse Motion Classifier** `(com.qti.sensor.motion_classifier)`, **Basic Gesture** `(com.qti.sensor.basic_gestures)` etc  which are not documented on offical android docs. Please refer to this [Blog](https://louis993546.medium.com/quick-tech-support-undocumented-mostly-qti-sensors-on-android-devices-d7e2fb6c5064) for corresponding values in `values` array  

## Supports multiple connections to multiple sensors simultaneously

 **Many Websocket clients** can connect to one `type` of a Sensor. So connecting to **`/sensor/connect?type=android.sensor.accelerometer`** three times will create three different connections to the accelerometer sensor and each connected client will then receive accelerometer data at the same time.
 
Moreover, from one or different machines you can connect to different types of sensors as well i-e one **Websocket Client object** could connect to accelerometer and other **Websocket Client object** to gyroscope. All active connections can be viewed by selecting **Connections** navigation button.
 
## Test with Websocket testing tools 
You can test this app with any websocket testing tools available on the web or playstore. You can use http://livepersoninc.github.io/ws-test-page/ for testing purpose. Use multiple tabs for multiple websocket connections

## Example: Websocket client (Python) 
Here is a simple websocket client in python using [websocket-client api](https://github.com/websocket-client/websocket-client) which receives live data from accelerometer sensor.

```python
import websocket
import json


def on_message(ws, message):
    values = json.loads(message)['values']
    x = values[0]
    y = values[1]
    z = values[2]
    print(f"x = {x} , y = {y} , z = {z}")

def on_error(ws, error):
    print("error occurred")
    print(error)

def on_close(ws, close_code, reason):
    print("connection close")
    print("close code : ", close_code)
    print("reason : ", reason  )

def on_open(ws):
    print("connected")
    

def connect(url):
    ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(url,
                              on_open=on_open,
                              on_message=on_message,
                              on_error=on_error,
                              on_close=on_close)

    ws.run_forever()
 
 
connect("ws://192.168.0.101:8080/sensor/connect?type=android.sensor.accelerometer") 

```
 *Your device's IP might be different when you tap start button, so make sure you are using correct IP address at client side*
 
## Using Multiple Sensors Over single Websocket Connection
You can also use to multiple sensors over single websocket connection. To use multiple sensors over single websocket connection use following **URL**.

                 ws://<ip>:<port>/sensors/connect?types=["<type1>","<type2>","<type3>"...]

By connecting using above URL you will receive JSON response containing sensor data along with a type of sensor. See complete example at [Using Multiple Sensors On Single Websocket Connection](https://github.com/umer0586/SensorServer/wiki/Using-Multiple-Sensors-On-Single-Websocket-Connection)

## Real Time plotting
See [Real Time Plot of Accelerometer (Python)](https://github.com/umer0586/SensorServer/wiki/Real-Time-Plot-Example-(-Python)) using this app

## Connecting over Hotspot :fire:
If you don't have Wifi network at your work place you can directly connect websocket clients to the app by enabling **Hotspot Option** from settings. Just make sure that websocket clients are connected to your phone's hotspot


## Connecting over USB (using ADB)
To connect over USB make sure `USB debugging` option is enable in your phone and `ADB` (android debug bridge) is available in your machine
* **Step 1 :** Enable `Local Host` option in app
* **Step 2** : Run adb command `adb forward tcp:8081 tcp:8081` (8081 is just for example) from client
* **Step 3** : use address `ws://localhost:8081:/sensor/connect?type=<sensor type here>` to connect 

Make sure you have installed your android device driver and `adb devices` command detects your connected android phone.
